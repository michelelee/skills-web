<h3>Finding the Button</h3>
<p>
  When you click this button, pop up an alert box. <b>Remember, you cannot change the HTML!</b>
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" class="tricky-to-find" value="Pop-Up Please!">
</fieldset>

<script>
function popUpnew() {
  alert('Popup');
}

$('.tricky-to-find').on('click', popUpnew);
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    You can find things by class name&mdash;but then you get back an array.

<h3>Down with Cats!</h3>
<p>
  After complaints from Cynthia about our cat-centered curriculum, you now need to change
  the following image of a cat to one of a dog when you double-click on the cat
  (you can Google for any cute dog photo you
  want). Do this in jQuery.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <img src="http://www.wallspick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Grey-Eyes-Cute-Cat-640x400.jpg"
       alt="Adorbz" id="kittenz-rule">
</fieldset>

<script>
  function changeimage(){
    $("img#kittenz-rule").attr("src","http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L66h0LdCcNU/UlJXlpOHz9I/AAAAAAAACSU/ZGvlfHdwIVM/s1600/pomsky+puppies+cute.jpg");
  }

  $('img#kittenz-rule').on('dblclick', changeimage)
</script>

<h3>Slowly Make a Porcupine</h3>
<p>
  After complaints from Joel about the lack of cute porcupines in our exercises,
  you're now tasked with having a cute porcupine appear when the button is pushed.
</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must pause one second after the button is pushed for the image to appear</li>
  <li>You should use a jQuery appear-via-animation method for this to appear. You can
  try things like <code>fadeIn</code> or <code>slideDown</code>. For extra points, can you
  make this animate itself happen slowly?</li>
</ul>

<fieldset>
  <img src="http://thebaconandicecreamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/animal-cute-jawn-porcupine-Favim.com-491057_large.jpg"
      id="cute-porcupine-image" style="display: none">
  <input type="button" id="make-a-porcupine" value="I Want a Porcupine!">
</fieldset>

<script>

setTimeout(function pork() {
  $('img#cute-porcupine-image').fadeIn();
}, 1000);

  $('#make-a-porcupine').on('click', pork);
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    You can make things happen after a second with <code>setTimeout</code>, a function
    Javascript can always use when inside a browser.
  </div>
</div>





<h3>An Agreeable Form</h3>
<p>
  When the user submits the form below, it should fill in the div to agree with the
  user. So if I saw my favorite food is "pretzels", a message should appear in that div
  that says "I like pretzels, too."
</p>

<fieldset>
  <form action="/oh-no-do-not-go-here" id="agreeable-form">
    What's your favorite food?
    <input type="text" name="favorite-food" required
           id="favorite-food-input">
    <input type="submit" value="I'm Very Agreeable">
  </form>
  <div id="agreeable-text"></div>
</fieldset>

<script>
  // put your code here
  $('#agreeable-form').submit(function (evt) {
    evt.preventDefault();
    $('#agreeable-text').html('I like ' + $('#favorite-food-input').val() + ", too!")
  }
  );

    You're right&mdash;we didn't show you how to find the current value in an input field
    using jQuery. Thank goodness for <code>console.dir(object)</code> or StackOverflow!

<h2>Advanced!</h2>
<p>
  Hey, we know you're smart and becoming a Javascript ninja. So we've given you these
  exercises which are, frankly, really tough. Don't feel badly if you need to practice the
  above a few times first, or need to get some hints or help here. They're trickier and
  definitely take much longer.
</p>
<p>You can either do these with or without jQuery, as you please.</p>
<p>But, really, these are <blink>hard</blink>.</p>




<h3>Number-Guessing Game</h3>
<p>
  Make the classic "guess-a-number-between-1-and-100" in Javascript.
</p>
<p>
  The user starts the game by clicking the button.
  This should then guess a random integer from 1 to 100 (StackOverflow is probably helpful here!).
  It should then keep popping up a Javascript <code>prompt</code> box to ask for a number.
  If you guess too high or too low, pop up an alert to say so. When the user gets the right
  number, congratulate them in an alert box, and then stop prompting them for numbers (well,
  at least until they press the button again!)
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" id="play-guessing-game" value="Play!">
</fieldset>

<script>
  // put your code here
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    How do you turn the string "42" into the integer 42 in Javascript? I'll bet
    StackOverflow knows!
  </div>
</div>






<h3>Less Annoying Number-Guessing Game</h3>
<p>
  That was fun! But, wow, all those alerts and prompts are annoying, aren't they?
</p>
<p>
  Write a new version that uses a simple form field for the number, and outputs the
  too-high/too-low/just-right into the div next to it.
</p>
<p>
  The game should start when they press the play button. Until they guess the right number,
  though, that button should no longer work again. Similarly, the numbered-guessed field
  and try-this-number button shouldn't be enabled if they're not playing. Tricky!
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" id="play-guessing-game-2" value="Play!">
  <form action="do-not-go-here" id="guessing-game-2-form">
    <input id="number-guessed" name="number-guessed" type="number" placeholder="Guess" disabled>
    <!-- hey! go read MDN about the "number" input type. Cool, huh? -->
    <input type="submit" id="try-this-number" value="Guess" disabled>
    <div id="number-guessing-msg"></div>
  </form>
</fieldset>

<script>
  // put your code here
</script>




<h3>Five Colored Primes</h3>
<p>
  When the button is pushed, five new boxes should appear in the bordered area.
  (A prime number is an integer greater than 1 which cannot be divided evenly by any other
  number other than itself and 1. For example, 11 is prime (you can only divide it by 1 and 11),
  while 12 is not (you can divide it evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6, along with 1 and 12).
</p>
<p>
  Each box should contain the text of the next prime number. Each box should have a different
  color, chosen from the list of colors in the Javascript. You can re-use our <code>prime-box</code>
  class to make your numbers look like ours, if you want (or feel free to experiment with other
  CSS).
</p>
<p>This should look like:</p>
<div>
  <div class="prime-box" style="background-color: orange">2</div>
  <div class="prime-box" style="background-color: midnightblue">3</div>
  <div class="prime-box" style="background-color: darkgoldenrod">5</div>
  <div class="prime-box" style="background-color: green">7</div>
  <div class="prime-box" style="background-color: purple">11</div>
</div>
<p>You must calculate the prime numbers; you cannot just type them in.</p>

<fieldset>
  <div id="prime-box-area"><!-- Your prime boxes should appear here! --></div>
  <input type="button" id="make-prime-boxes" value="Button">
</fieldset>

<script>
    var PRIME_COLORS = ['orange', 'midnightblue', 'darkgoldenrod', 'green', 'purple'];

  // put the rest of your code here
</script>





<h3>CSS Stuff</h3>
<p>
  This isn't so much of an exercise, but those of you interested in more intermediate/complex
  CSS, take a look at the CSS we use on this page&mdash;it shows off some interesting pseudo-selectors
  like <code>:before</code> and uses things like CSS numbering. Neat stuff.
</p>





<script>
  // Blink text FTW!

  var blinkies = document.getElementsByTagName("blink");

  function blink() {
    for (var i = 0; i < blinkies.length; i++) {
      var item = blinkies[i];
      if (item.style.color == 'white') {
        item.style.color = 'black';
      } else {
        item.style.color = 'white';
      }
    }
  }
  setInterval(blink, 500);
</script>
